# Axelar Local Dev: Your Cross-Chain Playground

The Axelar Local Dev environment empowers you to simulate the Axelar Gateway's cross-chain operations right on your local machine. You can establish local instances of multiple EVM chains, deploy your application-level executor contracts on the source/destination chains, and simulate cross-chain message relaying.

## Core Features

-   **Cross-Chain EVM Environment**: Easily set up a ready-to-use cross-chain development environment for EVM chains. For setting up cross-chain unit tests, refer to our [Executing Cross-Chain Transactions Guide](../../docs/guide_basic.md).

-   **Exporting Environments**: Effortlessly export your cross-chain development environment to designated ports separately. To learn more, check out our [Standalone Environment Setup Guide](../../docs/guide_create_and_exports.md).

Embrace the convenience of local development with Axelar Local Dev. Experience the power of cross-chain operations in the comfort of your development environment!
